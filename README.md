# Boilerplate
An empty template for starting new projects.

The boilerplate uses gulp to concat and minify the Sass and JavaScript files in the 'assets' directory. The gulp file includes a built in watch feature and live reload. Simply install the npm packages and run the 'gulp' command to get started.
