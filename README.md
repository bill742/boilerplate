# Boilerplate
An empty template for starting new projects.

The boilerplate uses gulp to concat and minify the Sass/CSS and JavaScript files in the 'assets' directory. It also includes an option to process CoffeeScript files and a function to optimize images. The gulp file includes a built in watch feature and live reload. Simply install the npm packages and run the 'gulp' command to get started.
